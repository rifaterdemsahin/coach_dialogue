## Coach Dialogue Application

1.  **Start New Dialogue (`cover.html`):** A form to define the context of the dialogue, including title, duration, scenario, user's role, plan of action, learning objectives, and rubric.
2.  **Continue Dialogue (`dialogue.html`):** A chat interface to interact with the coach.
3.  **View Summary (`summary.html`):** A page to view the summary and evaluation of the dialogue.
